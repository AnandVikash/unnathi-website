Later his association with one of the finest medical college and hospitals in India has helped him to get direct experience on clinical research challenges and opportunities especially in the area of nutrition and prophylactic. His transdisciplinary expertise was looking rare and unusual in India until recent years, the shift in higher education in India towards integrated learning and training has made him most suitable candidate for future higher education system in our country, especially in the area of health sciences.  </p><p>His work experiences include 12 Years in India, 5 Years in the USA.</p>",
