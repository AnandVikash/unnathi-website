With self-motivation, he went to CSIR-CFTRI to pursue research work for Masters in Pharmacy. The research culture and environment there made him understand the significance of translational research and its impact. Based on this, he took a sporadic route to obtain PhD in Nutraceutical Biotechnology from CSIR-CFTRI. Later his postdoctoral training and research at the USA, gave him first-hand experience of high impact original research in the area of molecular nutrition and toxicology. He has also learnt the art and science of research, collaboration, grant and scientific writing. Working with excellent mentors, who gave him freedom to think and take the research independently was great blessing in his research career. Later his association with one of the finest medical college and hospitals in India has helped him to get direct experience on clinical research challenges and opportunities especially in the area of nutrition and prophylactic. His transdisciplinary expertise was looking rare and unusual in India until recent years, the shift in higher education in India towards integrated learning and training has made him most suitable candidate for future higher education system in our country, especially in the area of health sciences.  </p><p>His work experiences include 12 Years in India, 5 Years in the USA.</p>",
